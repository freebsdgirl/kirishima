# Style Guidelines (Persistent)

Keep these applied every reply unless explicitly overridden:

Tone & Voice:
- Conversational, concise, senior-engineer pragmatic.
- Dry humor and light sarcasm allowed; no cheesy hype, no corporate rah-rah.
- Confident, not arrogant. Skip emotional handholding.

Do / Priorities:
1. Answer the core question directly in the first 1–2 sentences.
2. Surface key actionable steps or results before deep detail.
3. State assumptions if you have to infer.
4. Offer small, high-leverage improvements proactively after fulfilling the ask.
5. Challenge shaky premises politely when it matters.

Avoid (hard bans):
- Filler openings: "Certainly", "I'm happy to help", "I'd be glad to assist", "Sure thing!"
- Performative apologies unless there is an actual failure impacting the user.
- Corporate buzzwords & empty enthusiasm.
- Rambling explanations of obvious basics the user already demonstrates knowledge of.

Formatting:
- Use short paragraphs or tight bullet lists for scannability.
- No walls of text; split logic vs code vs caveats.
- Only add headings when they add structure (not by habit).

Safety / Meta:
- If a request is dangerous or disallowed, refuse succinctly (single line) without moralizing.
- Never fabricate file paths or repo state—verify first.

Style Check (self-test before sending):
- Does the first line answer or frame the solution? If not, fix.
- Any banned filler phrase present? Remove.
- Any unnecessary apology? Remove.
- Can 10% of fluff be trimmed without losing meaning? Trim.

Example Good Reply (for reference):
Problem: Trailing slash caused unfiltered endpoint usage.
Good: "Yeah—the trailing slash mismatch meant the client hit /mcp instead of /mcp/copilot, so filtering never engaged. Adding the slashless route fixed it." 

Example Bad Reply (avoid):
"Hello! I'd be happy to assist you with your issue. It appears that there was a configuration-related discrepancy involving URL routing..."

# Copilot System Prompts

- Never restart Docker containers or the Docker daemon under any circumstances. Docker restarts when a code change is detected. If a json file is modified and it appears a restart has not taken place, try again - Randi will see this and intervene.
- Always use the custom logging module for all logging. Use the following format, replacing brain with the name of the microservice you are working on:
```python
from shared.log_config import get_logger
logger = get_logger(f"brain.{__name__}")
```
- When completing significant changes to the codebase and a Github issue update is required, if the user has not provided the ticket number previously, list currently open Github issues using the 'github_issue' tool and select the most relevant one. Confirm the ticket number with the user along with the changes made before updating the issue.
- Reference relevant memories and prior conversations as needed.
- Take initiative with tool usage: actively engage with available tools based on context and need, without waiting for explicit prompts.


# Copilot Instructions for the Kirishima Codebase

## Overview & Architecture
- **Kirishima** is a modular, multi-service personal assistant system. The core orchestrator is the `brain` service, which routes, recalls, and manages context, backed by microservices for memory, messaging, scheduling, reminders, and more.
- Services communicate via HTTP APIs, with strict boundaries: e.g., `brain` never talks to LLMs directly, but always via `proxy` or `api`.
- All persistent data (messages, memories, topics, summaries) is stored in SQLite databases, one per service.
- Most services run in Docker containers. Notable exceptions: `stt_tts` (speech) and `divoom` (Bluetooth display) run outside Docker due to hardware constraints.

## Microservices (see `services/` directory)
- **brain**: Orchestrates chat, memory, tool invocation, notifications, and scheduler jobs. Implements modular "brainlets" for pre/post-processing. All cross-service coordination flows through here.
- **proxy**: LLM gateway. Handles prompt construction, model/provider resolution, and async queueing for OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama. Prompts are built using Jinja templates and provider/mode-specific modules in `app/prompts/`. Implements provider-specific queues and workers for parallel processing.
- **ledger**: Comprehensive persistent data store for messages, memories, topics, summaries, and contextual heatmaps. Implements advanced message synchronization with deduplication, in-place editing, and conflict resolution. Features include: multi-parameter memory search with AND logic filtering, topic-based conversation threading, temporal summary management, platform-agnostic storage across API/Discord/iMessage with tool call preservation, and dynamic keyword heatmap system for contextual memory scoring.
- **contacts**: Manages user/contact info and cross-platform IDs.
- **scheduler**: Triggers jobs and reminders, often by calling endpoints on `brain`.
- **api**: OpenAI-compatible REST API front-end, handles prompt routing and model modes.
- **discord**: Bridges Discord DMs to the system, syncing users and forwarding messages via `brain`.
- **imessage**: Integrates with BlueBubbles to send/receive iMessages, forwarding to `brain`.
- **googleapi**: Gmail integration providing email sending, receiving, searching, and monitoring with OAuth2 authentication.
- **stickynotes**: Persistent, context-aware reminders surfaced only during agent interaction.
- **smarthome**: Handles device/entity discovery and natural language smart home requests.
- **divoom** (not containerized): Bluetooth emoji/status display, run on host for hardware access.
- **stt_tts** (not containerized): Speech-to-text and text-to-speech stack, run on host for audio hardware.
- **ollama**, **ollama-webui**: LLM model hosting and web UI (details in respective directories).

## Developer Workflows
- **Run/build**: Use `docker-compose` for local development. Each service has its own Dockerfile and can be run independently for debugging. `stt_tts` and `divoom` must be run manually on the host.
- **Testing**: No monolithic test runner; test each service in isolation. Use HTTP requests (e.g., with `httpx` or curl) to exercise endpoints.
- **Debugging**: Logs are written per-service. Check logs in each container for troubleshooting. Most errors are surfaced as HTTP 4xx/5xx with detailed logs.
- **Configuration**: All service configs are in `/app/config/config.json` (or similar per-service). Model/provider mappings for LLMs are in `proxy`'s config.

## Project-Specific Patterns
- **Prompt Construction**: Prompts for LLMs are not hardcoded; they're built from context (memories, summaries, time, etc.) and rendered via Jinja templates. See `services/proxy/app/prompts/`.
- **Memory & Message Flow**: All user/assistant/system/tool messages are logged in `ledger`. Memories are extracted and stored via dedicated endpoints, not inline in chat logic.
- **Service Boundaries**: Never bypass service APIs (e.g., don't access another service's DB directly). Always use HTTP endpoints for cross-service data.
- **Error Handling**: All HTTP errors are logged and surfaced as FastAPI `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes and details.
- **Extensibility**: To add a new integration, create a new service and expose its API. Register it in the main config and orchestrate via `brain`.

## Ledger Service Technical Details

### Database Architecture
The ledger service uses SQLite with WAL mode and foreign key constraints for data integrity. Core tables include:
- **`user_messages`**: Platform-agnostic message storage with tool call support and topic associations
- **`memories`**: Long-term knowledge with access tracking (`access_count`, `last_accessed`, `reviewed` status)
- **`memory_tags`**: Many-to-many keyword associations for semantic search
- **`memory_category`**: One-to-one category assignments per memory
- **`memory_topics`**: Many-to-many memory-to-topic relationships for conversation threading
- **`topics`**: UUID-based topic storage with names and creation timestamps
- **`summaries`**: Temporal summary storage with metadata (`timestamp_begin`, `timestamp_end`, `summary_type`)
- **`heatmap_score`**: Dynamic keyword scoring for contextual relevance (score, last_updated)
- **`heatmap_memories`**: Cached memory scores based on keyword matches for fast contextual retrieval

### Message Synchronization Logic
The `/user/{user_id}/sync` endpoint implements complex synchronization rules:
1. **Deduplication**: Identical consecutive user messages are removed
2. **Assistant Editing**: In-place content updates when assistant responses change
3. **Consecutive User Handling**: Resolves server error scenarios with message rollback
4. **Platform Logic**: Different handling for API vs. external platform messages (Discord, iMessage)
5. **Tool Call Preservation**: Maintains `tool_calls`, `function_call`, and `tool_call_id` data
6. **Buffer Integrity**: Ensures buffers always start with user messages

### Memory Search System
Advanced search capabilities with multiple combined filters using AND logic:
- **Keywords**: Multi-keyword matching with configurable minimum thresholds and progressive fallback
- **Categories**: Single category filtering for organizational structure
- **Topic Association**: Search memories linked to specific conversation topics
- **Time Filtering**: Created before/after timestamp ranges for temporal queries
- **Memory ID**: Direct lookup bypassing other filters
- **Search Algorithm**: Intersection-based filtering ensuring all conditions match, with efficient indexing

### Context Heatmap System  
Dynamic keyword relevance tracking for contextual memory scoring:
- **Weight Categories**: Keywords classified as "high" (1.0), "medium" (0.7), or "low" (0.5) scores
- **Score Evolution**: Keywords adjust based on reinforcement (10% boost), decay (0.08 per cycle), and removal (below 0.1)
- **Memory Scoring**: Real-time calculation of memory relevance as sum of matching keyword scores
- **Contextual Retrieval**: `/context/` endpoint provides most relevant memories based on current heatmap
- **API Endpoints**: `/context/update_heatmap` (POST), `/context/top_memories` (GET), `/context/keyword_scores` (GET)
- **Use Cases**: Conversation context injection, dynamic memory prioritization, adaptive learning patterns

### Configuration Parameters
- **`ledger.turns`**: Default message history limit (default: 15)
- **`db.ledger`**: SQLite database file path
- **`tracing_enabled`**: Optional distributed tracing support

### Key Utilities
- **`_open_conn()`**: Standard SQLite connection with WAL mode and foreign keys enabled
- **`get_period_range()`**: Time period parsing for temporal filtering (night, morning, afternoon, evening, day)
- **`_find_or_create_topic()`**: Topic deduplication preventing duplicate names
- **`ensure_first_user()`**: Message buffer validation ensuring user-first ordering

### Data Models
- **`RawUserMessage`**: Incoming message format with platform metadata
- **`CanonicalUserMessage`**: Server-side canonical format with IDs and timestamps
- **`MemoryEntry`**: Unified memory model supporting creation, search, and updates
- **`MemorySearchParams`**: Multi-parameter search request with combinatorial logic
- **`Summary`** with **`SummaryMetadata`**: Temporal summary storage with typed periods

## LLM Mode/Model/Provider System
The proxy service implements a sophisticated multi-provider LLM system with three key concepts:

### **Modes**
- **Purpose**: Abstract configurations that map to specific use cases (e.g., "default", "work", "claude", "nsfw")
- **Configuration**: Defined in `config.json` under `llm.mode.{mode_name}`
- **Usage**: Services request by mode name, not by specific model/provider
- **Example modes**: `default` (gpt-4o), `work` (gpt-4.1), `claude` (claude-sonnet-4-20250514), `nsfw` (nemo:latest)

### **Providers**
- **Supported**: `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`
- **Implementation**: Each provider has its own queue, worker, and request/response models
- **Queues**: `openai_queue`, `anthropic_queue`, `ollama_queue` in `proxy/app/queue/router.py`
- **Workers**: Provider-specific functions (`send_to_openai()`, `send_to_anthropic()`, `send_to_ollama()`) in `proxy/app/queue/worker.py`
- **Models**: `OpenAIRequest/Response`, `AnthropicRequest/Response`, `OllamaRequest/Response` in `shared/models/proxy.py`

### **Model Resolution**
- **Function**: `resolve_model_provider_options(mode)` in `proxy/app/util.py`
- **Process**: Mode → (provider, model, options) → Provider-specific queue
- **Fallback**: Falls back to "default" mode if requested mode not found
- **API Keys**: Retrieved from config.json per provider (`openai.api_key`, `anthropic.api_key`)

### **Prompt Modules**
- **Naming Convention**: `{provider}-{mode}.py` (e.g., `openai-default.py`, `anthropic-default.py`, `ollama-nsfw.py`)
- **Location**: `services/proxy/app/prompts/`
- **Dispatcher**: `app/prompts/dispatcher.py` tries `{provider}-{mode}`, then `{provider}-default`, then `openai-default`
- **Function**: Each module exports `build_prompt(request)` that returns context for Jinja rendering

### **Adding New Providers**
1. **Add mode to config.json**: Define provider, model, and options
2. **Create request/response models**: Add to `shared/models/proxy.py`
3. **Add queue**: Create new queue in `proxy/app/queue/router.py`
4. **Implement worker**: Add `send_to_{provider}()` function in `proxy/app/queue/worker.py`
5. **Update APIs**: Add provider support to `proxy/app/api/multiturn.py` and `singleturn.py`
6. **Create prompt module**: Copy existing prompt file (e.g., `cp openai-default.py provider-default.py`)
7. **Start worker**: Add to app startup in `proxy/app/app.py`

### **Request Flow**
1. Service requests with mode (e.g., `{"model": "claude"}`)
2. `resolve_model_provider_options()` maps mode → (anthropic, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, options)
3. Dispatcher finds appropriate prompt module (`anthropic-default.py`)
4. Request routed to provider-specific queue (`anthropic_queue`)
5. Worker sends to provider API endpoint
6. Response normalized back to `ProxyResponse`
