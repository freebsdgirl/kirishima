# üß† Full Architecture

## üß≠ Architectural Principles

- **Brain is the primary orchestrator.**
- **The Proxy is the only service allowed to communicate with any LLM.** Prompt scaffolding, model selection, and stream handling are owned by the Proxy.
- **Centralized logging is mandatory.** All services must emit structured debug and error logs to Graylog.
- **Semantic search is overhyped.** We use SQLite here.
- **Cross-platform conversation continuity is mandatory.** All interactions feed into a unified conversation thread.
- **Agent autonomy over user convenience.** The AI maintains its own perspective, relationships, and decision-making capabilities.

## üåü Core Innovations

### üî• Heatmap Memory System

Traditional AI memory relies on vector similarity searches that treat all memories as equally accessible. Kirishima implements a **weighted topic tracking system** that mirrors human memory patterns:

- **Dynamic Multipliers**: Keywords receive multipliers (0.1x-1x) based on conversation patterns
- **Conversation-Based Decay**: Topics "cool down" when attention shifts naturally, not on rigid time windows
- **Contextual Relevance Scoring**: Memory retrieval prioritizes topics that are "hot" in current conversation context
- **Associative Linking**: Related concepts heat up together, supporting natural thought flow

This approach is particularly effective for neurodivergent conversation patterns where traditional folder-based organization fails.

### üîÑ Unified Conversation Flow

Most AI systems treat each platform interaction as isolated. Kirishima's **Ledger** creates true cross-platform conversation continuity:

- **Platform-Agnostic Threading**: Voice, text, email, Discord all contribute to single conversation thread
- **Message Deduplication**: Intelligent handling of cross-posted or repeated messages
- **Context Preservation**: Switch mid-conversation between platforms without losing context
- **Agent-Centric Logging**: Conversations are logged from the AI's perspective, not just user interactions

### üß† Self-Modifying Agency

The AI can **modify its own system prompt** through the `manage_prompt` tool:

- **SQLite-Backed Prompt Storage**: Personality and behavioral changes persist across restarts
- **Experience-Driven Evolution**: The AI adapts based on interaction outcomes
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Can advocate for its own architectural changes
- **Professional Identity**: Maintains its own email, GitHub account, and professional relationships

## üß† System Architecture Overview

### üåê API

Adapter layer between OpenAI-style clients (e.g., OpenWebUI) and the internal Kirishima ecosystem.

**Responsibilities:**

- Accepts incoming messages from OpenAI-compatible clients
- Distinguishes between structured task calls and standard chat
  - For example, OpenWebUI sends tasks as `### Task:` which bypass normal LLM flow
- Routes messages to Brain for processing
- Converts internal shared class models into OpenAI response format before returning

**Design Notes:**

- Does not handle any memory, context, or summarization logic
- Has no direct LLM access
- All processing is delegated to Brain and Proxy
