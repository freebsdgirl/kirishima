# Kirishima: MCP Server Integration & Tool Orchestration Planning

## Summary of Discussion

- **Tool Usage & Autonomy:**
  - Copilot and similar agentic LLMs achieve high tool autonomy via strong system instructions and an orchestration layer, not just prompt engineering.
  - Kirishima's brainlets (e.g., memory_search) act as an orchestration layer, injecting context and managing tool calls, even when the LLM is passive.
  - True agentic behavior comes from combining explicit system-level enforcement with modular, API-driven tool exposure.

- **MCP Server Concept:**
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers expose tools and workflows as standardized API endpoints, making them accessible to any agent (LLM, Copilot, etc.).
  - Moving Kirishima's tools/brainlets to an MCP server makes them reusable, agent-agnostic, and future-proof.
  - Brain is the natural place to implement the MCP server, as it already orchestrates all cross-service coordination.

- **Tool Categorization & Logging:**
  - Persistent tools (e.g., add_memory, create_stickynote) should write to ledger.
  - Ephemeral tools (e.g., memory_search) should not write to ledger, to avoid cluttering context/history.
  - Planning/"intents" logic can be a brainlet, an MCP tool, or both, depending on how much autonomy you want to give the agent.

- **Tool Discovery:**
  - Prefer dynamic tool discovery via MCP over static tools.json, but keep tools.json for bootstrapping if needed.

- **Single FastAPI App:**
  - All MCP and internal endpoints can be served from a single FastAPI app using APIRouter for modularity.

# MCP Server Integration & Tool Orchestration: Planning Guide

## 1. MCP Server Implementation in Brain
- Use FastAPI for the MCP server, leveraging APIRouter to organize endpoints (e.g., `/mcp/` for MCP tools).
- Expose each tool/brainlet as an endpoint (e.g., `/mcp/memory_search`, `/mcp/add_stickynote`, `/mcp/intents`).
- Follow MCP spec for request/response formats (JSON, with tool name, parameters, and context).
- Implement a `/mcp/tools` endpoint for dynamic tool discovery (returns available tools and schemas).

## 2. Tool Routing & Categorization
- Route each MCP endpoint to the corresponding internal function, brainlet, or service API.
- **Persistent tools:** Write to ledger (e.g., add_memory, create_stickynote).
- **Ephemeral tools:** Do not write to ledger (e.g., memory_search, get_context).
- **Planning tools:** Expose an `/mcp/intents` endpoint for tool suggestion/planning, powered by a brainlet or sub-agent.

## 3. Ledger Sync & Logging
- Only log persistent, user/system-generated content to ledger.
- Do not log ephemeral tool outputs unless needed for audit/debugging.
- Log all tool invocations for traceability.

## 4. Authentication & Access Control
- Add API key or token-based authentication for MCP endpoints if exposing externally.

## 5. Migration Path
- Start by exposing a few core tools (memory_search, add_stickynote, get_context) via MCP.
- Gradually migrate more brainlets/tools to MCP as needed.
- Keep legacy tools.json for bootstrapping, but prefer MCP for dynamic discovery.

## 6. Documentation
- Auto-generate OpenAPI docs from FastAPI routes for easy agent integration and testing.

## Terminology Clarification

**MCP (Model Context Protocol):** The standardized API layer that exposes tools to any agent. This is the "server" part.

**Intent-Based Orchestration:** The intelligent middleware that decides which tools to execute based on context, user input, and model behavior. This replaces the current brainlet system.

Industry terms you might see:
- "Tool orchestration" 
- "Agent workflow management"
- "Function calling orchestration"
- "Multi-agent coordination"

"Intents" is perfectly fine and descriptive. It's commonly used in conversational AI (like Google Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework).
