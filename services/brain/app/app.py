"""
This module initializes and configures the FastAPI application for the "brain" service.

It includes the following functionalities:
- Registers routers for various components such as memory, buffer, modes, scheduler, docs, message handling, models, and embeddings.
- Sets up system-level routes and documentation routes.
- Configures message-related routes with specific prefixes and tags.
- Optionally enables tracing if the `TRACING_ENABLED` configuration is set to `True`.

Modules and Routers:
- `memory_router`: Handles memory-related operations.
- `buffer_router`: Manages buffer-related functionalities.
- `modes_router`: Provides endpoints for mode configurations.
- `scheduler_router`: Manages scheduling tasks.
- `docs_router`: Serves API documentation.
- `message_router`: Handles general message-related operations.
- `message_multiturn_router`: Manages multi-turn message interactions.
- `message_singleturn_router`: Handles single-turn message interactions.
- `models_router`: Provides endpoints for model-related operations.
- `embedding_router`: Manages embedding-related functionalities.
- `routes_router`: Defines shared system-level routes.

Tracing:
- If tracing is enabled via the `TRACING_ENABLED` configuration, the `setup_tracing` function is invoked to integrate tracing capabilities with the application.
