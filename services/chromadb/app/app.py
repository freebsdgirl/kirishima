"""
This module initializes and configures the FastAPI application for the ChromaDB service.

It includes the following routers:
- `routes_router`: Handles system-level routes.
- `docs_router`: Handles documentation-related routes, accessible under the `/docs` prefix.
- `memory_router`: Handles memory-related routes, accessible under the `/memory` prefix.
- `summarize_router`: Handles summarization-related routes, accessible under the `/summary` prefix.
- `buffer_router`: Handles buffer-related routes, accessible under the `/buffer` prefix.

Tracing:
- If tracing is enabled (`shared.config.TRACING_ENABLED`), the application sets up
    tracing using the `setup_tracing` function from the `shared.tracing` module.

Dependencies:
- FastAPI is used to create the application and manage routing.
- Shared configurations and tracing utilities are imported from the `shared` module.
