"""
This module provides FastAPI endpoints for deleting conversation messages from the buffer database.

Endpoints:
- DELETE /ledger/conversation/{conversation_id}/before/{message_id}:
    Deletes all messages in a conversation up to and including a specified message ID.
- DELETE /ledger/conversation/{conversation_id}:
    Deletes all messages for a specific conversation.

Utilities:
- _open_conn(): Opens a SQLite connection to the buffer database with WAL journal mode.

Models:
- DeleteSummary: Response model summarizing the number of deleted messages.

Logging:
- Uses a module-specific logger for operational logging.
