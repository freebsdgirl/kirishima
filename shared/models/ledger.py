"""
This module defines a set of Pydantic models for representing and processing user messages and conversation messages 
in both raw and canonical forms, as well as a summary model for delete operations.
Classes:
    RawUserMessage:
        Represents a raw user message exchanged between a user and the system. Includes attributes such as user ID, 
        platform, role, and message content.
    CanonicalUserMessage:
        Represents a canonical user message exchanged between a user and an assistant. Includes additional attributes 
        such as unique message ID, creation timestamp, and update timestamp.
    RawConversationMessage:
        Represents a raw message within a conversation, typically used for storing or processing messages from various 
        platforms. Includes attributes such as conversation ID, platform, role, and message content.
    CanonicalConversationMessage:
        Represents a canonical message within a conversation, typically used for storing and retrieving messages from 
        various platforms. Includes additional attributes such as unique message ID, creation timestamp, and update 
        timestamp.
    DeleteSummary:
        Represents a summary of a delete operation, tracking the number of rows deleted during the operation.
